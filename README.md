# 3D Tetris Game in Unreal Engine using C++

This project is primarily aimed at learning the Unreal C++ API and . An overview of the project's features are below

## Learnings

- **3D Gameplay**: Converting Classic Tetris gameplay adapted to a 3D environment
- **Grid System**: Utilizes Unreal Engine's 'Vector Snapped to Grid' function to ensure blocks align perfectly within the 3D space.
- **Implemented Interfaces**: Various interfaces are implemented to manage game logic, block interactions,
( Removed the interfaces in the project till now to clean up the project a bit, realised it isn't necessary in a small project)

- **C++ to Blueprint Communication and vice versa**: Extensive use of Unreal C++ API function calls to handle game mechanics, UI updates, and player controls.

- **Should start learning Game Art Design tooðŸ˜…ðŸ˜†**

## Gameplay Instructions

- Movement: Use the arrow keys or A and D to move the blocks horizontally.

- Rotation: Use the spacebar to rotate the falling tetroids

- Drop: Hold the S to drop the blocks quickly.



## Bugs To Solve

- Choppy Rotation of some of the tetroids (shape S and line shape)

- tetroid might get stuck between the boundary sometiimes while rotating
